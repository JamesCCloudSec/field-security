# Field Security Practice & Documentation

This repository contains personal security operations testing, documentation, and practice workflows developed outside of formal contract engagements.

## Purpose

To record real-world learning, experimentation, and execution of defensive cybersecurity principles, toolkits, hardening strategies, and operational procedures. All work is performed on personal systems in preparation for future deployment in professional environments.

## Structure

- `docs/` – Walkthroughs, system hardening logs, backup strategies, partitioning, encryption workflows, and incident response notes.
- `scripts/` – PowerShell and batch scripts tested and refined in lab conditions.
- `images/` – Screenshots and diagram references as needed.
- `toolkit/` – Notes on portable USB/OS builds, encrypted storage, and recovery utilities.

## Notes

- This repository reflects **personal initiative and training**.  
- All systems used are **non-client environments**.  
- Documentation may be adapted for future production use when required.
