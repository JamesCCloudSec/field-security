## [2025-04-11] Vault Reset + Redeployment

- Destroyed unrecoverable 12GB VeraCrypt volume (test vault with missing credentials).
- Used Disk Management to delete volume, reformat, and re-encrypt partition.
- Vault rebuilt with proper documentation and Bitwarden entry (stored in `Vault Recovery - [DriveName]`).
- Completed full cycle from recognition → recovery → deployment in under 2 minutes.
- Updated SOPs to enforce Bitwarden backup **prior** to vault commit.
