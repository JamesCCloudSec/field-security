# Dark Souls: PTDE Binary Analysis â€“ Field Security Sandbox Investigation

## Summary
This case study documents a security-focused, controlled analysis of a legacy Dark Souls: Prepare to Die Edition executable. The investigation was performed as part of a personal field security operations project and focused on binary behavior, system impact, and forensic response workflows â€” **not game piracy**. The user owns a legitimate license but lost access due to the title's removal from all official platforms.

## âš  Legal and Ethical Disclaimer
This analysis does **not** condone piracy or redistribution of cracked software. The purpose was to:
- Conduct real-world malware forensics using a non-malicious binary suspected of instability
- Practice detection workflows in a sandboxed environment
- Reinforce knowledge of system isolation, threat detection, and forensic tooling

All tests were conducted **air-gapped**, with no network access, and **without launching or distributing pirated content.**

---

## Objective
- Assess whether a legacy game crack was malicious or simply non-functional
- Use standard industry tools to verify integrity, behavior, and possible risks

---

## Environment Setup
- **Host Specs**: 24-core CPU, 32GB RAM
- **Virtualization**: VirtualBox with Windows 11 VM
- **VM Config**:
  - 6 virtual cores
  - 12 GB RAM
  - Network adapter: disabled
  - Shared clipboard + drag-and-drop: disabled
  - Snapshot taken before execution

---

## Tools Used
- **RegShot**: Registry diff before/after execution
- **HxD**: DLL Inspection to discover stripped **Metadata**
- **Malwarebytes + Windows Defender**: Full scan and offline scan
- **Autoruns**: Startup persistence check
- **Process Monitor**: Runtime behavior observation
- **Manual inspection**: File diff, logs, and behavioral analysis

---

## Phase 1: Initial Binary (Crack #1)
- Immediately flagged by Windows Defender and Malwarebytes
- Behavior blocked before execution
- Identified as potential spyware and Trojan
- Removed automatically, no persistent changes

**Status**: *Abandoned* â€“ insufficient trust for deeper testing

---

## Phase 2: Secondary Binary (Crack #2)
- Not flagged by AV engines
- Executed in VM successfully
- Game loaded to menu, crashed at name entry
- RegShot + Autoruns: no persistence, no unauthorized system changes
- No outbound network activity observed
- Post-run virus scans: *clean*

**Status**: *Likely benign, but broken/crude patchwork DLL*

---

## Analysis Conclusion
- Crack #2 demonstrated **no malware indicators** under scrutiny
- Most likely issue: outdated or mismatched `steam_api.dll`
- Root cause of crash likely bad emulation of the Steam API version
- Entire workflow followed security best practices for sandboxing and rollback

---

## Operational Lessons
- Legacy binaries can trigger false positives or unstable behavior
- Not all flagged files are malicious â€” but due diligence matters
- Air-gapped VM + snapshot combo is ideal for low-trust software evaluation
- Real-time behavioral tools + registry tracking = powerful forensic toolkit

---

## Takeaway for Portfolio
This investigation showcases:
- Threat modeling and behavioral inspection
- Practical VM hardening and rollback usage
- Registry forensics using RegShot
- AV scan validation with offline tools
- Professional judgment in walking away from unsafe binaries

---

## ðŸ’¡ Future Work
- Compare alternative cracks from groups like Goldberg or 0xdeadc0de
- Test Steamless unpacked binaries paired with legit `steam_api.dll`
- Turn this into a live malware triage demo or write-up for blog/YouTube
