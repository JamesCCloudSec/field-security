## Operational Security: Toolkit Expansion, Encryption, and Backup Readiness

**This document outlines my practical implementation and learning across system hardening, encrypted storage, partition control, and backup strategy. It reflects real-world tasks completed over two full working sessions while building and deploying a functional, portable security toolkit for client work and personal application.** 

**Status:** Tested on personal machine only. Full deployment at client site (Rina's Traditions [Ethan]) is planned.

---

## Account Separation and Windows Hardening

- Built a clean admin-standard user model on my personal system to simulate client environment.
- Admin accounts: `SysAdmin` and `LaptopAdmin` created for privileged tasks only.
- Standard accounts: `JamesDesktop` and `JamesLaptop` used for daily operations.
- Configured systems to require password on wake, 5-minute auto-lock, and prevent privilege escalation.
- Verified usability from standard user perspective and confirmed elevated access prompts work as expected.

üõ†Ô∏è **Resume Highlight:**  
User account control implementation, Windows privilege management, user-mode hardening

---

## VeraCrypt Encryption and Partition-Level Control

**Gained full understanding of VeraCrypt encryption modes:**

- Standard container-based encryption (`.hc` files)
- Full partition encryption for non-OS data
- Risks and complexity of system encryption

**Hands-on Work:**

- Created a new 12GB partition on my primary SSD without affecting the OS.
- Successfully encrypted the new partition and mounted it using an alternate drive letter.
- Removed the drive letter from the encrypted volume for cleanliness.
- Verified that mounting and unmounting work flawlessly.

üõ†Ô∏è **Resume Highlight:**  
Data-at-rest encryption, VeraCrypt configuration, disk partitioning and recovery planning

---

## Controlled Folder Access

- Enabled Controlled Folder Access (CFA) on Windows Defender.
- Added protection to test folders.
- Whitelisted tools like SyncBackFree to ensure backup compatibility.
- Simulated a restricted access scenario to verify CFA behavior.

üõ†Ô∏è **Resume Highlight:**  
Defensive controls implementation, ransomware prevention techniques, security exception management

---

## Toolkit Visibility and USB Cleanliness

- Identified the VTOYEFI partition from Ventoy.
- Used DiskPart to remove the drive letter from VTOYEFI, keeping the bootloader functional while hiding unnecessary partitions in Explorer.
- Observed and validated that Windows no longer displayed the partition while maintaining USB boot reliability.

üõ†Ô∏è **Resume Highlight:**  
System visibility reduction, USB toolkit hardening, multi-boot USB architecture

---

## RescueZilla and System Imaging

- Learned the RescueZilla live boot and imaging process.
- Tested boot on Ventoy.
- Estimated image size (12‚Äì25GB compressed) for clean systems without games/media.
- Confirmed how to identify source disks and select appropriate external targets.
- Plan to use RescueZilla for Ethan‚Äôs system snapshot after deployment.

üõ†Ô∏è **Resume Highlight:**  
Disaster recovery planning, full system image creation, bootloader & partition integrity testing

---

## SyncBackFree File-Level Backup

- Set up trial backup profiles to simulate client use.
- Compared Backup vs Mirror vs Sync behavior.
- Verified default log storage path.
- Discovered email notifications are not available in SyncBackFree; noted the upgrade path to SyncBackSE.
- Developed a plan to combine backup logging with Bitwarden-secured vaults for high-integrity retention.

üõ†Ô∏è **Resume Highlight:**  
Backup automation testing, differential backup strategy, secure log archival

---

## Partition Management & Best Practices

- Practiced partition resizing and volume creation.
- Learned Windows limitations (e.g., can‚Äôt hide EFI volumes via Disk Management UI).
- Used DiskPart to remove drive letters on sensitive or boot-related partitions.
- Verified behavior when encrypted partitions are mounted and system letters change.

üõ†Ô∏è **Resume Highlight:**  
Partition management, drive mapping integrity, Windows recovery-layer adjustments

---

## Security Stack Operational Readiness

- System hardening (accounts, UAC, CFA)
- Encryption workflows (containers and partitions)
- File and system-level backup tooling (SyncBackFree + RescueZilla)
- Toolkit prep (Ventoy, partition cleanup, vault design)
- Usability and post-deployment client behavior planning

üõ†Ô∏è **Resume Highlight:**  
Security stack design, layered defense implementation, toolkit deployment planning

---

## Summary

This document reflects a fully simulated security deployment tested on a non-client system. All systems and practices will be formally implemented at the client site using this framework.
